    <p>Our Hon’ble Prime Minister,<strong><u> Shri Narendra Modi </u></strong> , envisages a Digital India to bridge the digital divide in our
        country and further promote digital literacy in order to make development a comprehensive mass movement and put
        governance within everyone’s reach in India. In order to work towards our PM’s vision, MHRD, All India Council for
        Technical Education (AICTE), Inter Institutional Inclusive Innovation Center (i4C), and Persistent Systems organized
        Smart India Hackathon 2017, a unique initiative to identify new and disruptive digital technology innovations for
        solving the challenges faced by our country. The initiative was a huge success. To reiterate the efforts towards our
        PM’s vision, MHRD, AICTE, i4C, and Persistent Systems is proud to propose the 2nd edition of this initiative – Smart
        India Hackathon 2018. Till date, 45+ union ministries and departments and 18 state governments have already joined
        this grand initiative, making it much bigger than the previous edition. Through this initiative, govt. departments
        will directly engage with thousands of technical students and challenge them to build digital solutions to improve
        their efficiency, plug revenue leakages and corruption. Smart India Hackathon 2018 is a non-stop digital product
        development competition, where problems are posed to technology students for innovative solutions.
