        <p>Cybercriminals always choose an easy way to make big money. They target rich people or rich organizations
            like banks, casinos and financial firms where the transaction of a huge amount of money is made on an
            everyday basis and hack sensitive information. Catching such criminals is difficult. Hence, that increases
            the number of cyber-crimes. Computers are vulnerable, so laws are required to protect and safeguard them
            against cyber criminals. Following are the reasons for the vulnerability of computers: Easy to access – The
            problem behind safeguarding a computer system from unauthorized access is that there are many possibilities
            of breach due to the complex technology. Hackers can steal access codes, retina images, advanced voice
            recorders etc. that can easily fool biometric systems and bypass firewalls can be utilized to get past many
            security systems. Capacity to store data in comparatively small space – The computer has the unique
            characteristic of storing data in a very small space. This makes it a lot easier for people to steal data
            from any other storage device and use it for their own profit. Complex – The computers run on operating
            systems and these operating systems are programmed of millions of codes. The human mind is imperfect, so
            they can do mistakes at any stage. The cyber criminals take advantage of these gaps. Negligence – Negligence
            is one of the characteristics of human conduct. So, there may be a possibility that protecting the computer
            system we may make any negligence which provides a cyber-criminal the access and control over the computer
            system. Loss of Evidence – The data related to the crime can be easily destroyed. So, Loss of evidence has
            become a very common & obvious problem which paralyzes the system behind the investigation of cyber-crimes.

            How to Prevent Cyber Crime? To deal with the situation of cyber crime effectively, one needs to establish
            multi-dimensional public-private collaborations between law enforcement agencies, the information technology
            industry, information security organizations, internet companies, and financial institutions. Unlike the
            real world, cyber criminals do not fight one another for supremacy or control. Instead, they work together
            to improve their skills and even help out each other with new opportunities. Hence, the usual methods of
            fighting crime cannot be used against cyber crimes in India. Use Strong Passwords: Use the different
            password and username combinations for different accounts and resist the temptation to write them down. Keep
            Your social media accounts private: Be sure that you keep your social networking profiles (Facebook,
            Twitter, YouTube, etc.) private. Be sure to check your security settings. Be careful of what information you
            post online. Once it is on the Internet it is there forever. Secure your Mobile Devices: Many people are not
            aware that their mobile devices are also vulnerable to malicious software, such as computer viruses and
            hackers. Be sure to download applications only from trusted sources. It is also crucial that you keep your
            operating system up-to-date. Be sure to install anti-virus software and to use a secure lock screen as well.
            Otherwise, anyone can access all your personal information on your phone if you misplace it or even set it
            down for a few moments. Someone could even install malicious software that could track your every movement
            through your GPS. Protect your data: Protect your data by using encryption for your most sensitive files
            such financial records and tax returns. Protect your identity online: When it comes to protecting your
            identity online it is better to be too cautious than not cautious enough. It is critical that you be
            cautious when giving out personal ID such as your name, address, phone number and/or financial information
            on the Internet. Be certain to make sure websites are secure when making online purchases, etc. This
            includes enabling your privacy settings when using/accessing social networking sites. Keep your computer
            current with the latest patches and updates: One of the best ways to keep attackers away from your computer
            is to apply patches and other software fixes when they become available. By regularly updating your
            computer, you block attackers from being able to take advantage of software flaws (vulnerabilities) that
            they could otherwise use to break into your system. Protect your computer with security software: Several
            types of security software are necessary for basic online security. Security software essentials include
            firewall and antivirus programs. A firewall is usually your computer’s first line of defense. It controls
            who and what can communicate with your computer online. You could think of a firewall as a sort of
            “policeman” that watches all the data attempting to flow in and out of your computer on the Internet,
            allowing communications that it knows are safe and blocking “bad” traffic such as attacks from ever reaching
            your computer. How to prevent cyber crime Cyber Crime and Cyber Laws In order to curb the menace caused by
